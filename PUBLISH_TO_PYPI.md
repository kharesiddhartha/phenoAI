## 🔧 Step-by-Step Publication Process

### Step 1: Create PyPI Accounts

#### 1.1 Test PyPI Account (Recommended First)
1. Go to https://test.pypi.org/account/register/
2. Create an account with your email
3. Verify your email address
4. Enable 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)

#### 1.2 Production PyPI Account
1. Go to https://pypi.org/account/register/
2. Create an account (can use same email)
3. Verify your email address
4. Enable 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)

### Step 2: Generate API Tokens

#### 2.1 Test PyPI Token
1. Go to https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/
2. Scroll to "API tokens" section
3. Click "Add API token"
4. Name: `phenoai-upload`
5. Scope: `Entire account` (for first upload)
6. **SAVE THE TOKEN** - you can't see it again!

#### 2.2 Production PyPI Token
1. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/
2. Scroll to "API tokens" section  
3. Click "Add API token"
4. Name: `phenoai-upload`
5. Scope: `Entire account` (for first upload)
6. **SAVE THE TOKEN** - you can't see it again!

### Step 3: Configure Twine

Create a `.pypirc` file in your home directory:

**Windows:** `C:\Users\{username}\.pypirc`
**macOS/Linux:** `~/.pypirc`

```ini
[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi
    testpypi

[pypi]
username = __token__
password = pypi-YOUR_PRODUCTION_API_TOKEN_HERE

[testpypi]
repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
username = __token__
password = pypi-YOUR_TEST_API_TOKEN_HERE
```

### Step 4: Upload to Test PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "c:\Users\hp\Downloads\PhenoAI 1.2"

# Upload to Test PyPI
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

#### Test Installation from Test PyPI
```bash
# Install from Test PyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ phenoai

# Test the installation
python -c "from phenoAI import PhenoAI; print('Import successful!')"

# Test CLI
python -m phenoAI.cli --help
```

### Step 5: Upload to Production PyPI

If Test PyPI upload was successful:

```bash
# Upload to Production PyPI
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

### Step 6: Verify Publication

#### Check PyPI Page
- Visit: https://pypi.org/project/phenoai/
- Verify all metadata appears correctly
- Check description, links, and classifiers

#### Test Installation
```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install phenoai

# Test with TensorFlow support
pip install phenoai[tensorflow]

# Test with all dependencies
pip install phenoai[all]
```

## 🎯 Post-Publication Tasks

### Update Documentation
1. Update README.md with PyPI installation instructions
2. Add PyPI badge to repository
3. Update any documentation mentioning installation

### Create Release on GitHub
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Releases" → "Create a new release"
3. Tag: `v1.2.0`
4. Title: `PhenoAI v1.2.0 - PyPI Release`
5. Description: Include changelog and installation instructions

### Monitor and Maintain
1. Watch for user feedback and issues
2. Plan future releases with version bumping
3. Keep dependencies updated
4. Monitor download statistics

## 🔄 For Future Updates

### Version Bumping Process
1. Update version in `pyproject.toml` and `setup.py`
2. Update CHANGELOG or release notes
3. Commit changes: `git commit -m "Bump version to X.Y.Z"`
4. Create git tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z`
5. Push changes: `git push origin main --tags`
6. Build new package: `python -m build`
7. Upload to PyPI: `python -m twine upload dist/*`

### Automated Publishing (Advanced)
Consider setting up GitHub Actions for automated PyPI publishing on release tags.
